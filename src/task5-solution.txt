1. Type Check Error in addUser Method: In the addUser method, there's a condition that checks if both id and name are of type number, which is incorrect since name should be of type string. The correct condition should check if id is a number and name is a string.

2. Inconsistent Return Type in getUser Method: The getUser method is supposed to return a user object of type { id: number; name: string }. However, if the user is not found, it implicitly returns undefined which is not mentioned in the method's return type. To fix this, the return type should be modified to include undefined.

3. Strict Equality Comparison: In the getUser method, the equality comparison (==) between user.id and id might not be strict enough for certain coding standards which prefer strict equality (===) to avoid unexpected type coercion.
